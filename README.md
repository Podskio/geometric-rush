# Geometric Rush

This project was completed by a team of five within 12 hours for ZotHacks 2023.

This project is a simple platformer that utilizes the Matter.js physics engine and React.js to allow the player to drop shapes into the level. The player can then use these shapes to traverse past various obstacles in their way to get to the arrow sign, which will take them to the next level. The game includes 5 levels of varying difficult and requires the player to think creatively to solve each one.
